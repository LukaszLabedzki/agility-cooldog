We are a small store from Germany. We produce and sell sustainable dog toys. With our products we pay attention to sustainability, all rubbers were already in use before we use them and we use yarn made from recycled PET bottles. If the rubber or ball breaks, you can easily replace it and you dont need to throw away the entire toy. For every sold reToy product we donate a part to organizations working for dogs in need and we let plant a tree by an organisation for that. Additional you can also find products from other manufacturers in our shop for example: out-n-out, JW Pets, Puppingtonsâ€¦ We are happy to be a part of the sponsors for Polish Open and we are looking forward to se you there at our sales booth. See you in februaryðŸ˜Š
