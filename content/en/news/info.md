#### COMPETITION

The competition schedule will be published on the website.

The starting lists will be published a couple of days before the competition on the website â€“ if you know you wonâ€™t come, please let us know in advance.

Bitches in heat run in the normal order â€“ each ring has a rug for them to start from â€“ please notify the steward if you need it. Please also be considerate and separate bitches in heat from other dogs whenever possible.

The starting lists will be also displayed on monitors next to the rings.

Ring 1 will be for XS, S and M for all three days, ring 2 for ML/L for all three days.

There will be a steward for each ring. Please be next to the ring at least 4-5 teams before your run and report to the steward to confirm the running order. If youâ€™re running with more than one dog and need to change your running order â€“ please talk about it with the stewards ONLY (not the workers in the office) â€“ they can change it as needed.

The results will be displayed on the monitors next to the rings â€“ please follow the results as we will do the prizegiving ceremonies soon after the run is finished, so be ready for the podium.

#### REQUIRED DOCUMENTS

There will be a registration during which we will check the passports â€“ you are required to have valid rabbies vaccination. Anyone failing to show it will not be allowed to compete.

We wonâ€™t collect the working books, but if you want to have your results written in your working book, we can do it during one of the breaks â€“ just come to the office.

#### HALL

The hall will be locked for the night, so you might leave your things there if you like.

There are also spectators stands, but you might bring your own chairs with you if you prefer.

There are three rooms where you can keep your dogs â€“ however, they are quite small. We donâ€™t make bookings. Please be nice and share the space as much as possible.

Please keep the hall clean â€“ itâ€™s professional great quality football grass so leave it in as good condition as you find it . That includes picking up the fluff from sheepskin tugs etc.

There will be option to buy proper food inside the hall, as well as hot and cold drinks.

There will also be lots of shopping stands of our sponsors â€“ so prepare for shopping.
