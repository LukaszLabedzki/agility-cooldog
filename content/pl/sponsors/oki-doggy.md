Order dog tug tailored to your needs. I sew tugs from natural sheep, goat and rabbit skins. All of them will be available for purchase at the stand during the competition. However, if you have less standard needs, write to me on messenger. A tug with three balls, two fur ends, additional reinforcements, or on a very long tape? Everything can be done. Or maybe you want to supply a team or a school for dogs with training tugs?
